# [The Odin Project: Flickr-API](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-flickr-api)

## Description
This project is to build simple Flickr-API using full-featured client gem called Flickr 2.0.
Also implemented on this project is the use of Figaro gem to masquerade the api and shared keys. 

## Skills and Knowledge gain
I have learnt how to use external APIs using ruby gems. It is quite a simple process once you gain basic understanding of it.
Gem figaro allows secure rails configuration by sensoring sesitivie user information like API keys.
